Mathematical pattern recognition of human movement

Project Overview
This project, part of HW 5, focuses on applying mathematical pattern recognition techniques to analyze human movement. The main goal of this project is to classify different types of motion using time series data extracted from motion sensors.

Target
Extract and utilize time domain features to classify human motion.
Implement various machine learning models for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Compare the effectiveness of different feature extraction methods, including principal component analysis (PCA), and evaluate their impact on classification accuracy.

method
Feature creation/extraction: Extract temporal features from human motion datasets using statistical measurements (mean, minimum, maximum, etc.).
Classification techniques: Apply logistic regression for binary classification and explore a variety of multi-class classification methods, including Gaussian Naive Bayes.
Dimensionality reduction: Implement PCA for feature dimensionality reduction to enhance model performance.
Evaluation: Compare the performance of different classifiers and feature selection methods on a test dataset.

Main findings
The application of PCA and feature selection methods significantly affects the classification accuracy.
Gaussian Naive Bayes and logistic regression were found to be effective for multi-class classification of human movement types.
Dimensionality reduction and feature extraction methods play a crucial role in improving the efficiency and accuracy of classification models.
